/* 
    EXPRESSION VS. STATEMENT

    Expression: evaluates to a value. It could be a calculation or a combination of values.

    Example: let x = 5 + 3 ( 5 + 3 is an expression ). 
    5 +3 evaluates to 8 therefore it's an expression.
    But the whole line is a statement.

    Expressions are used as the building blocks within statements.

    Example: 

    x * y (evaluates to the product of variables x and y)
    Math.sqrt(16) (evaluates to the square root of 16 which is 4)

    Statement: Are like full sentences and they made up of expressions.
    A statement is a COMPLETE line of code that performs some action.

    Example:
    let myNumber = 5;
    if (myNumber > 10){}

    // full command lines are statements, the place where variables are defined are expressions.
