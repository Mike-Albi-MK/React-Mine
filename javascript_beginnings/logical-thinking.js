/* HOW TO SOLVE A PROBLEM – LOGICAL THINKING AND ALGORITHM

Analzye the problem before start coding (What is being asked from you?)

For that purpose we can use algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions to solve a problem.

Example – preparing tea

    1. Gather every tool you're gonna need (each tool is a variable)

    2. Pour water 

    3. Plug the kettle

    4. Wait for it to boil

    **********************

    Add milk and sugar
    serve the tea

An algorithm is usually represented in a graphical way called "flow chart"
(see example images)

We can also use pseudocode to get us started.

Example (write a program that checks if student passed a test and save results somewhere)

    If student's grade is greater than equal to 60
    save "passed"
    else 
    save "failed"
